- Plantostore is an online app for purchasing vegetables, written in `React-Native`.
- The app retrieves the plants & users data using `HTTP REST` requests via `axios`.
- The app includes custom `middleware` to dispatch `async functions` & `Redux` data.
- The user's purchased items & cart data are stored in `local-storage` & `Firebase` remote DB to support `online` & `offline` usage.
- The user registration is done via `Firebase authentication`. (Don't worry, it's a very short process 📝✔️ )
