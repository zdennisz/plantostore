# Plantostore 🌱
- Plantostore is an online app for purchasing vegtables, written in `React-Native`.
- The app retrives the plants & users data using `HTTP REST` requests via `axios` from remote DB.
- The app includes custom `middleware` to displatch `async functions` & `Redux` data.
- The user's purchased items & cart data are stored in `local-storage` & `Firebase` remote DB to supposrt online & offline useage.
- The user registration is done via `Firebase authentication`. (Don't worry, it's a very short process :) )

> Never let the lack of space discourage you from buying any more plants. 🛍️
